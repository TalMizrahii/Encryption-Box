## About
The Encryption Box is a program based on the Vigenere cipher.
It asks the user to enter a key (more than 2 characters for safer encryption), and plaintext to encrypt. Then, the program presents the encrypted message.
If the user wishes to decrypt the message, he can do so by clicking the "Decrypt" button in the menu.
In this program, I used the "Tkinter" library for the GUI.

*IMPORTANT* - If you wish to run the program, you can downlaod the "EncryptionBox.exe" file. 


## The cipher
The Vigenere cipher was issued in 1553. It is a polyalphabetic cipher, which uses a key to encrypt plaintext into ciphertext. The main advantage of it is that it is highly resistant to frequency analysis.
